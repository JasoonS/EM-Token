Structure of a smart contract file (after pragma and imports)

- **Library uses**
- **Type definitions** e.g. enums and structs
- **Storage declaration**
- **Events**
- **Constructor** if needed
- **Modifiers**
- **Public and external functions** i.e. the ones you can call from outside
- **Internal functions** i.e. the ones that are to be inherited and used from upstream (yet will not be directly callable from outside)
- **Private functions** e.g. data access functions etc
