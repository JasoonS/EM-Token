/**
 * @title RoleControlled
 * @dev The RoleControlled contract implements a generic role modifier that can be used to control role
 * based access to contract methods. It works in a similar fashion to the *Role contracts in OpenZeppelin
 * in https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/access/rolescd (e.g. MinterRole.sol),
 * but all the methods take a string parameter to denote a specific role. This way, OpenZeppelin's MinterRole's
 * OnlyMinter() modifier can be implemented as OnlyRole("minter")
 * @dev An special, predefined AdminRole role is provided. The constructor sets this admin role for the contract
 * owner, and this role cannot be renounced. So in essence, Ã’nlyRole(AdminRole) is equivalent to the OnlyOwner()
 * modifier from the traditional Ownable contract.
 * @dev This has already been migrated to the EternalStorage construct, so all storage variables are used through
 * the EternalStorageWrapper
